About the Project
-----------------

CLAMS tools aim to generate metadata and knowledge from A/V material that may be hidden or invisible to archivists and database indexes. CLAMS is also designed to be used by computer scientists and developers of content analysis tools within an interoperable platform for custom workflows and pipelines.

The project is under active development. Contact us for any concerns or suggestions at admin@clams.ai.
